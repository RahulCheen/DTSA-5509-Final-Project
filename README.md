In this project, I use the Walkability Index dataset ([published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index7)) to build and test supervised learning models to predict walkability of U.S. Census Blocks. Predicting walkability is important for allocating infrastructure funding for areas with low pedestrian accessibility. Improving city walkability can promote for public health and safety as well as reduce automobile traffic and improve environmental health due to reduced emissions.

The models I will use are multilinear regression and gradient boosting. In this report, I will walk through the data I use, how I intend to use it, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis prior to building the models themselves. Model performance will be assessed at the end of the report.
